Acts As Taskable
===========================

Acts as Taskable is a Rails plugin that allows any ActiveRecord class to automatically accept tasks

== Install ==
 
 * Run the following command:
 
 script/plugin install http://acts-as-taskable.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/acts_as_taskable
 
 * Generate and apply the migration:

 ruby script/generate acts_as_taskable_migration
 rake db:migrate

== Usage == 
 
 * Make you ActiveRecord model act as taskable.
 
 class Model < ActiveRecord::Base
   acts_as_taskable
 end
 
 * Add a task to a model instance
 
 model = Model.new
 task = Task.new
 task.title = 'Kill bill'
 task.due_bye = Time.now.next_week
 task.user_id = @user.id   # The id of any specific user.
 model.tasks << task

 * Retrieve all tasks for a model instance
 
 model.tasks     # Yes! It is AS easy as that
